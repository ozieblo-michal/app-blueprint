# Application Design and Analysis Blueprint

## :dart: 1. Project Goals and Context
This section defines the strategic and contextual foundation of the application. It explains what the project aims to solve, who it is for, and how it fits into the business or user landscape.

**1.1. Project Objective**  
Defines the overall goal of the project — what the application is expected to achieve and why it is being built.

**1.2. Project Structure Overview**  
Explains the structure and organization of the documentation or project artifacts to help readers navigate the content easily.

**1.3. Problem Description**  
Describes the real-world problem or gap that the application intends to address, providing context and justification for the solution.

**1.4. User Stories**  
Presents high-level scenarios that reflect what users need from the system, written from their perspective to capture expectations and goals.

**1.5. Stakeholder Requests** (RUP: STRQ)  
A structured list of requirements or desires collected from stakeholders, serving as a bridge between business needs and system features.

**1.6. Business Processes** (BPMN)  
Visual models of key business workflows the application must support, helping to align the system with real-world organizational operations.

**1.7. System Features** (RUP: FEAT)  
A categorized list of high-level system capabilities that support the business processes and fulfill stakeholder expectations.

**1.8. Constraints**  
Details limitations, assumptions, or boundaries that affect the design, scope, or operation of the system (e.g. legal, technical, time).

**1.9. Alternatives and Competitors**  
Identifies existing solutions or competitive systems and explains why this particular solution is being proposed instead.

**1.10. Glossary** (RUP: TERM)  
Defines all domain-specific terms, acronyms, and key phrases used throughout the documentation to ensure shared understanding.



## :clipboard: 2. Requirements
This section outlines the specific needs the system must fulfill. It includes both functional and non-functional requirements, as well as technical and performance constraints.

**2.1. Functional Requirements** (FURPS)  
Lists specific system behaviors and capabilities — what the system must do in response to input or to achieve business goals.

**2.2. Non-Functional Requirements** (FURPS, UX)  
Covers system qualities such as usability, reliability, performance, and scalability, which define how well the system must perform.

**2.3. Additional Requirements**  
Captures other important technical or operational needs that do not fall neatly under standard functional or non-functional categories.

- **2.3.1 System and Hardware Requirements**  
  Specifies technical dependencies such as operating systems, server specs, databases, or other platform-related expectations.

- **2.3.2. Performance Requirements**  
  Defines speed, throughput, latency, or other quantitative performance criteria the system should meet.

- **2.3.3. Operating Environment Requirements**  
  Describes the environment in which the application must run, such as browser versions, mobile devices, or deployment scenarios.

- **2.3.4. Quality Requirements**  
  Lists expectations for maintainability, testability, resilience, or other aspects related to the long-term viability of the system.

**2.4. Priority List and MVP**  
Ranks features or requirements by importance and identifies the minimal viable product (MVP) — the smallest set of features to deliver value early.



## :arrows_counterclockwise: 3. Processes and Interactions
This section explains how users and the system interact. It ensures that every functional need is traceable to stakeholder expectations and described through actionable scenarios.

**3.1. Traceability Matrix: Stakeholder Requests → Functional Requirements**  
Maps stakeholder needs to specific functional requirements to ensure full traceability and proper coverage of business expectations.

**3.2. Actors and Use Cases** (UML + Scenarios)  
Identifies all user roles and describes how each interacts with the system through use cases, using UML and scenario descriptions.

**3.3. Traceability Matrix: Functional Requirements → Use Cases**  
Links each functional requirement to one or more use cases, ensuring the functional scope is fully represented in the system behavior.



## :brain: 4. System Analysis
This section focuses on analyzing the system's internal logic and structure before moving into technical design. It bridges business logic and future implementation.

**4.1. Domain Model** (Domain Classes)  
Describes the core business concepts and their relationships in the form of classes — often used as a foundation for data modeling.

**4.2. Analytical Classes** (BCE Pattern)  
Identifies boundary, control, and entity classes based on system interactions and business logic — a key step in logical architecture.

**4.3. VOPC Diagrams**  
Visual representation of system architecture in terms of View, Object, Process, and Control — aligning features with their structure.

**4.4. Sequence / Communication Diagrams** (UML)  
Illustrates dynamic interactions between system elements over time to explain the flow of messages, events, and operations.



## :building_construction: 5. Design Phase
This section provides the technical architecture and specification needed for implementation. It transitions the abstract analysis into concrete, buildable elements.

**5.1. Design Classes** (UML Class Diagrams)  
Concrete class definitions including attributes and methods — derived from analytical classes, ready for implementation.

**5.2. Logical Data Model** (ERD/UML)  
Defines how business concepts are translated into structured data relationships — the blueprint for database design.

**5.3. Physical Data Model** (DDL)  
Specifies the actual implementation of the logical data model in a specific DBMS — including tables, indexes, and constraints.

**5.4. System Components** (UML Component Diagram)  
Shows how the system is divided into logical components/modules and their dependencies — key for modular development.

**5.5. System Interfaces** (UI / API / Endpoints)  
Describes the user-facing and system-facing interfaces, such as UI views, REST APIs, input/output formats, or third-party integrations.

**5.6. System Deployment** (UML Deployment Diagram)  
Defines how and where the system will be physically deployed — including servers, containers, network nodes, or cloud infrastructure.



## :test_tube: 6. Testing
This section defines how the system will be verified and validated. It helps ensure that the implementation meets all specifications and is secure, stable, and ready for release.


**6.1. Testing and Security Plan**  
Outlines how the system will be verified and validated, including test strategy, coverage areas, roles, and security considerations.

**6.2. Acceptance Tests vs. Use Cases**  
Maps use cases to test scenarios to ensure that all functional expectations are validated from the user's perspective.

**6.3. Technical Dependencies and Risks**  
Lists known risks and external factors (libraries, APIs, platforms) that might impact the success or stability of the implementation.
